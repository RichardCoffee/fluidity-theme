To display a sidebar, you can use one of the two sidebar classes that Fluidity
provides.  Only the Theme specific sidebar =must= be used in order for the
sidebar theme options to work correctly.  Both classes default to displaying
the sidebar using 'get_template_part' in accordance with wordpress recommended
practice.  Please note that these classes do not attempt to control the actual
sidebar widget displayed.  That is controlled elsewhere in 'includes/sidebar.php'.


TCC_Theme_Sidebar
--------------------
The first sidebar class is for the page main sidebar and always obeys the
theme option sidebar setting.  It can be initialized like this:

TCC_Theme_Sidebar::get_instance( array(
	'action'     => 'tcc_before_main',
	'css'        => 'col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-12 col-xs-12',
	'horizontal' =>  false,
	'root'       => 'sidebar',
	'sidebar'    => 'sidebar_slug',
);

'action' is optional, and defaults to 'tcc_before_main'.  You generally will
	not want to change this since it is automatically set if on a mobile device.

'css' is optional, and defaults to the theme option setting.  If set then the
	main tag css would also need to be set manually.

'horizontal' is optional, and should only be set if the sidebar is to be
	displayed in a horizontal fashion.  If set, then the sidebar will always be
	displayed where the 'action' parameter is set to, and will not be moved nor
	hidden on a mobile device.  If set, then you should also manually set the
	'css' parameter.

'root' is optional and defaults to 'sidebar'.  This is used as the first
	parameter that is passed to 'get_template_part'. If the sidebar template part
	is located in a sub directory, then this can be set to '<directory>/sidebar'.

'sidebar' is optional and will default to the page slug.  It is used as the
	second parameter passed to 'get_template_part'.  This parameter may also
	affect the sidebar widget displayed, but it is not controlled by this class.


TCC_Widget_Sidebar
---------------------
The second class is TCC_Widget_Sidebar.  This is an optional class that need
not be used at all, and only exists as a helper class for TCC_Theme_Sidebar.
It is included here for informational purposes.  It will accept the same
parameters as TCC_Theme_Sidebar and can be called like this:

$sidebar = new TCC_Widget_Sidebar( array(
	'action'     => 'tcc_before_main',
	'css'        => 'col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-12 col-xs-12',
	'horizontal' =>  false,
	'root'       => 'sidebar',
	'sidebar'    => 'sidebar_slug',
);

Note that the 'action' parameter will never be changed by this class, even on mobile
devices, and you should always set the 'css' parameter.
