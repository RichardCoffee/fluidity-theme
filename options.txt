This file describes how to implement a new tab on the Theme Options screen.

The admin options screen is controlled by the form layout array.  The array
is initialized in the Fluidity_Options_Form class, which is defined in
classes/options.php.  That file contains an explanation of the item arrays,
and is the definitive guide.  In cases where this document conflicts with
the options.php file, the options.php should be considered the more
reliable source.  The various tabs on the options screen are defined in
these files:

  Design: classes/design.php, filter priority 10
  Layout: classes/layout.php, filter priority 20
  Colors: classes/colors.php, filter priority 30
  About:  classes/options.php, no priority, will always be last

When adding a tab to the screen, classes/design.php can be used as a guide.

The form layout array has this structure:

  Array ( 'design' => Design form tab array,
          'layout' => Layout form tab array,
          'colors' => Colors form tab array,
          'about'  => About form tab array );




The form tab array has this structure:

  Array (  'title'     =>  text that will appear on the tab itself.  WordPress
                           will also display this as the section title.
           'describe'  =>  name of, or pointer to, a function which will
                           display desired content at the top of the
                           screen, appearing just under the title.
           'option'    =>  option name, used to save and retrieve the data
                           array.  If not specified, the default will be set
                           as "fluidity_options_{key}".
           'layout'    =>  main array, used to display and format all the options

The layout array contains the keys of every item appearing on the form screen

  Array ( 'option1' =>  option 1 item array
          'option2' =>  option 2 item array
          'option3' =>  option 3 item array


The option item array has these required fields:

  'default' =>  must be present, even if blank.
  'label'   =>  text that appears on the left side of the screen.  Identifies
                the option.
  'render'  =>  suffix of method used to display the item, ie: 'radio' will
                cause the 'render_radio' method to be called.  Possible
                values are checkbox, colorpicker, display, font, image,
                radio, select, text, textarea, wp_dropdown, skip
  'help'    =>  text displayed as a title attribute.  set for both the label
                and the input item.
