This file describes how to implement a new tab on the Theme Options screen.

The admin options screen is controlled by the form array.  The array is
initialized in the Fluidity_Options_Form class, which is defined in
classes/options.php.  That file contains an explanation of the item arrays,
and is the definitive guide.  In cases where this document conflicts with
the options.php file, the options.php should be considered the more
reliable source.  The various tabs on the options screen are defined in
these files:

  Design: classes/design.php
  Layout: classes/layout.php
  Colors: classes/colors.php
  About:  classes/options.php

           'title'     =>  text that will appear on the tab itself.
           'option'    =>  option name, used to save and retrieve the data array
           'layout'    =>  main array, used to display and format all the options

The layout array contains the keys of every item appearing on the form screen

          'option2' =>  option 2 item array
          'option3' =>  option 3 item array


The item array has these required fields:

  'default' =>  must be present, even if blank.
  'label'   =>  text that appears on the left side of the screen.  Identifies the option.
  'render'  =>  determines how
