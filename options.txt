This file describes how to implement a new tab on the Theme Options screen.

The admin options screen is controlled by the form layout array.  The array
is initialized in the Fluidity_Options_Form class, which is defined in
classes/options.php.  That file contains an explanation of the item arrays,
and is the definitive guide.  In cases where this document conflicts with
the options.php file, the options.php should be considered the more
reliable source.  The various tabs on the options screen are defined in
these files:

  Design: classes/design.php, filter priority 10
  Layout: classes/layout.php, filter priority 20
  Colors: classes/colors.php, filter priority 30
  Social: classes/social.php, filter priority 100
  Admin:  classes/settings.php, filter priority 500
  About:  classes/options.php, no priority, will always be last

When adding a tab to the screen, classes/design.php can be used as a guide.

The form layout array should have this structure:

  Array ( 'design' => Design form array,
          'layout' => Layout form array,
          'colors' => Colors form array,
          'social' => Social Icons form array,
          'admin'  => Admin form array
          'about'  => About form array );


The form tab array has this structure:

  Array (  'title'     =>  text that will appear on the tab itself.  WordPress
                           will also display this as the section title.
           'describe'  =>  name of, or pointer to, a function which will
                           display content at the top of the screen,
                           appearing just under the title.
           'option'    =>  option name, used to save and retrieve the data
                           array.  If not specified, the default will be set
                           as "fluidity_options_{key}".
           'layout'    =>  main array, used to display and format all the options


The layout array contains the keys of every item appearing on the form screen

  Array ( 'option1' =>  option 1 array
          'option2' =>  option 2 array
          'option3' =>  option 3 array


The item option array has these fields:

  'default' =>  required - must be present, even if blank.
  'label'   =>  required - text that appears on the left side of the screen.
                Identifies the option.
  'text'    =>  optional - text displayed with the option.
  'help'    =>  optional - text displayed as a title attribute.  set for both
                the label and the input item.
  'render'  =>  required - suffix of method used to display the item,
                ie: 'radio' will cause the 'render_radio' method to be called.
                Possible values are checkbox, colorpicker, display, font,
                image, radio, select, text, textarea, wp_dropdown, skip
